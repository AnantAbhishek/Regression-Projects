# Project 1
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. <br/>
We need to know :- <br/>
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.<br/>
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands. <br/>
***Tech Stack :- Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Scikit learn, statsmodel***<br/>
    * EDA was performed and the relevant features are extracted for prediction. ***I used multiple linear regression for the problem and adjusted r2 and r2 as the performance metrics.<br/>
    * Different features were dropped based on their statistical significance and high VIF(Variance Inflation Factor).<br/>***
**Based upon the data analysis and model building, I was able to achieve the r2 = 81% and adjusted R2 = 80.4%**
